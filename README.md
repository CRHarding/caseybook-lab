# CaseyBook Multi-Part Lab Extravaganza!

## Broken down into multiple parts:
### [Part 1](https://github.com/CRHarding/caseybook-lab-part-1/blob/main/README.md): Initial create-react-app setup with a plain profile page as landing page (including introduction to class components and state)
### [Part 2](https://github.com/CRHarding/caseybook-lab-part-2/blob/main/README.md): Create a presentational component and pass down props, added bonus of an independent exercise to create another component and pass...you guessed it, even more props!
